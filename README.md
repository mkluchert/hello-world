# hello-world
just another hello-world repository

I've been working professionally in the IT world since '96.  I started as a programmer and have other job titles like Senior Software Developer, Application Architect, Business Analyst and Senior Solution Architect.  When people ask me what I do I tell "I'm a problem solver".  All of my experience has been designing, developing and implementing enterprise merchandise management systems.

I have coded in VB.NET, T-SQL, PL-SQL, OpenROAD, C, C++ and once upon a time I even did some COBOL.  I have spent the bulk of my career doing database development, mostly SQL Server.

Recently I realized that I've been missing out on all sorts of good things in the open source world.  Creating a GitHub account is my first step in joining this world.  I hope to create a number of repositories as I create experimental software for personal use and some stuff for friends.
